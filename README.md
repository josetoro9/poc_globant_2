# Globant PoC challenge #2

In this challenge #2, we carried out two data exploration processes to meet the objectives set by the company.

## Applications you will need:
- _**MySQL Workbench**_
- _**Tableau**_

The way it was developed was using **MySQL** using _**MySQL Workbench**_, and in this repository you will find the 3 stages of development:

- _**'data_preparation.sql'**_
- _**'sql_globant.sql'**_
- _**'second_step.sql'**_

## How to use

The way to carry out the execution depends on how you want to present the reports that are generated. For example, _**'data_preparation.sql'**_ can be executed from _**MySQL Workbench**_ or it can be integrated as the final part of the Python process that takes information to MySQL to generate more productive information.

1. Connect Tableau to the database, below you will find the necessary credentials.
2. Set up the queries to feed the dashboards.
3. Update the dashboards.
